# Unreal Refrence

## Introduction
For the past two weeks I have been working on an Unreal live project with the tech acadmey.
We were given a simple sandbox to start with with some very basic assets and a basic level to start with, and we were given no rules on what to make.
I decided on a third person shooter for my project, a fairly simple game where you played a wizard trying to get a magic scroll to win.

## Story 1: Landscape and Structures
In this story, no coding was needed. It was just to make a level for the player to play in. I chose to learn the landscape and foliage tools as well as I could.
I created a basic landscape and got some building and plant props from a free asset pack on the marketplace. I used the foliage painter to place all of the grass and trees.
I also took a stab at making a terran material that I could use to blend various textures together. Namely a grass and gravel texture. This was the hardest part of this story, but I managed to figure it out.

## Story 2: GameMode and HUD
In this story, I set up the player spawn and controller, as well as got a HUD working. The HUD was pretty simple, with a health bar and a mana bar. This was also the first story where I had a player character to run around with.

This was also my first forray into coding for Unreal. Here is what the HUD graph looks like.

## Story 3: Collectables/Obstacles
In this story I set up various collectables for the player. Since I planned for the enemies to be the obstacle for this game, but those were covered in a later story I just added some logic for a gate that blocks the player.
For collectables, I had a health and mana potion as well as the scroll that would win the game. I made the mana potion first and based all the rest on it.

## Story 4: Menus
In this story I created various menu's for the game. This proved to be much easier than previous engines I've used. A simple widget and a blank level was all I needed to add a main menu, how to play, game over, and victory screens.

The graph for the main menu. All the other screens had simular functions, though this one is the most complicated.
